    "Simple Summary of What the Script Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Clean and Prepare Data:\n",
    "        Remove bad columns: The clean_features() function is designed to remove any columns in the DataFrame that have too many missing values (more than 5%) or contain infinite values.\n",
    "        Ensure numeric data: The ensure_numeric() function converts all columns to numeric types, forcing any non-numeric values (like strings) to become NaN (missing data).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Process Each Subfolder:\n",
    "        The script looks through a parent directory and processes each subfolder one by one.\n",
    "        For each subfolder, it checks if the folder contains a .zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extract Features from the Zip File:\n",
    "        If a zip file is found in the subfolder, the script uses a tool (probably flirt.with_empatica) to compute features from the zip file. These features could include:\n",
    "            HRV (Heart Rate Variability) features\n",
    "            EDA (Electrodermal Activity) features\n",
    "            Accelerometer (ACC) features\n",
    "        The features are computed using windows of 30 seconds with a step size of 1 second between windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Clean and Save Data:\n",
    "        The script ensures that all features are numeric (using ensure_numeric()).\n",
    "        It then saves the computed features to a CSV file in the same subfolder where the zip file was located, with a filename based on the subfolder name and zip file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Error Handling:\n",
    "        If anything goes wrong while processing a zip file, it catches the error and prints a message without crashing the entire script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The script processes zip files in subfolders, extracts time-based features (HRV, EDA, ACC), cleans the data, ensures it's numeric, and saves the results to CSV files.\n",
